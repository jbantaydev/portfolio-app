        I am a software engineer focused on backend APIs and data workflows, currently
        expanding my UI skills with React. I have hands-on experience with Node.js,
        PHP/Yii2, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and AWS services like S3, SQS, and Lambda. I care
        about reliability, clean interfaces, and fast feedback loops in development.
